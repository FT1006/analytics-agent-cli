# Analytics Agent CLI

An analytics agent that understands plain English, analyzes your real data locally, and integrates directly into your existing workflow.

**Not another analytics tool** â€“ Skip SQL and custom syntax; just ask questions naturally.
**Not another chatbot** â€“ Actually performs real analytics operations on your data.
**Not another web app** â€“ Works directly with your local files and folders.

**Before:** Export data â†’ Upload to ChatGPT â†’ Manually implement suggested analysis â†’ Visualize results yourself
**After:** Run in your local folder: `> What drives order value? Show me a chart.`

## Why This Matters

Traditional analytics tools force translation from business questions into code. Generic LLM chatbots discuss data without truly analyzing it.

Analytics Agent CLI introduces a new paradigm: **real-world analytics operations through natural conversation**.

### Imagine a future where:

* **Product managers** explore data without learning SQL.
* **Analysts** validate logic interactively before building pipelines.
* **Engineers** receive clear, pre-validated analytics requirements.

This working prototype demonstrates that future today.

## Local Integration Advantages

* **Direct File Access** â€“ No data copying between tools.
* **Real Workflow Integration** â€“ Results saved directly in your project folders.
* **Controlled Data Exposure** â€“ You precisely select data for analysis.
* **Developer-Friendly** â€“ Fully terminal-based, integrates seamlessly into existing workflows.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ cd examples/ecommerce_analytics  
$ aacli
> find drivers of high-value orders

ðŸ”§ Analyzing ecommerce_orders.csv...

Found key correlations with high order value:
- **Customer segment**: Premium customers spend +67% more
- **Product category**: Electronics drive 3.2x higher average orders
- **Payment method**: Credit card payments are 41% higher

> visualize premium customer behavior
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/FT1006/analytic-agent-cli.git
cd analytic-agent-cli
pip install -e .

# Setup API Key (Free from Google AI Studio)
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Try it
cd examples/ecommerce_analytics
aacli
```

## How It Fits Your Workflow

* **Explore quickly** â€“ Validate analytical ideas in minutes.
* **Stakeholder alignment** â€“ Discuss clear analytics insights in plain English.
* **Rapid deployment** â€“ Confidently implement validated logic in production tools (Airflow, dbt, Alteryx).

## Common Commands

**Data Quality Checks:**

* `> check data quality issues`
* `> summarize distribution of order values`
* `> identify outliers`

**Analytical Queries:**

* `> correlate features with sales`
* `> segment customers by behavior`
* `> compare month-over-month performance`

**Visualization & Reporting:**

* `> generate a trend chart`
* `> export insights as HTML`
* `> provide statistical summary`

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Google Gemini API key (free tier available)
* Optional enhancements: pandas, openpyxl

**Note**: Currently supports Google Gemini API only. Support for additional LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) is planned for future releases.

## Project History

Analytics Agent CLI evolved from [Staffer](https://github.com/FT1006/staffer), a personal project exploring AI-powered workflow automation. This version focuses specifically on analytics capabilities and local file integration, representing a specialized branch of the original concept.
